Today I watched a new Netflix series, Decoupled. It was a hilarious watch. I don't think I have laughed so hard, ever. I think it is funny not because of their main premise, marriage, but the incidents in the show that is either building the character or just consequential. I took up watching it as the portrayal was about marriage thinking I'd get a kick watching it with my wife. Both of us enjoyed it although not for the original intentions.

It seems that I'm complaining of having had such a good time but I'm not. It feels like the authors took a base idea and they added generic comedy to the plot. It could have had just two people, not even couples, and the show would have been just as funny.
