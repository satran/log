Day 1

I have always wanted to write. But the fear of perfection has prevented me to write. I wanted to have the right topic, the right words, and the right context. Perfection has hindered me from writing down my thoughts. I read an article^([[https://perell.com/note/intellectual-loneliness/|Intellectual Loneliness]]) where the author wrote to solve the problem of intellectual loneliness. 

> Writing on the Internet is the best way to solve intellectual loneliness because sharing ideas in public turns you into a magnet for like-minded people.

I want to have interesting conversations. I don't want to have "Mindless conversations about the news that regurgitate the same tired storylines." The act of writing is to open up my thoughts to the world hoping to spark off conversations that are intellectual.
