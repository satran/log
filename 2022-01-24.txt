I'm struggling with finding a medium to keep track of my tasks. They are also so intertwined with notes that I take in meetings that I usually look for the same medium for both. The struggle is between text files and paper. Both have its advantages and disadvantages. 

Paper is simple. I don't have to worry about synchronisation. I don't have to worry about keeping work and home separate, well not much. It is very flexible. I can make doddles on them if I want. 

Text files are more organisable. I can create multiple lists, reorder them and it can be on my mobile as well as on my laptop.

Notes should be searchable. They should be always available. But tasks don't. So a paper notebook would not have its limitations for this.
