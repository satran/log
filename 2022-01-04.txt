# Day 4

I started reading [[Troublesome Words]], by Bill Bryson. This book writes about words that are confused often. One of the early things I learnt was the difference between abbreviations, acronyms, and contractions. 

Abbreviation is the general term used to shorten a word; BASIC(Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) or HTTP(HyperText Transport Protocol). Acronyms are abbreviations that are pronounceable. So here BASIC would be an acronym while HTTP would be an abbreviation. 

Contractions are short forms of words like can't for cannot.
