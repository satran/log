# Day 3

Life is akin to developing software; we iterate. The first version could have been terrible, but as time passes and bugs are fixed, it slowly becomes a stable system. 

In life we iterate. We start with small experiments as we grow up. I look at my four year old daughter gauging my reaction to something that she has been asked not to do. Sometimes she experiments by doing the exact opposite to understand what the limits and reactions are. As we grow we pick up more experiences, we iterate. When we fail we learn from it. Some, like falls from heights, teach up painful lessons and others are gentle.
