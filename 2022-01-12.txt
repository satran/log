To paper or not to paper, that is the question. Even though these may not be the best choice of words, some lingering memory of learning Hamlet in school, there lies an important question. Is it better to use paper and pen than the multitude of applications that are so easily found for personal management.

There are definite advantages and disadvantages of both medium. Some of these are better suited for some tasks and some others. For example when taking notes, it is important these are searchable. Here I can see computer applications doing a better job at this (although, I know of some that are horrendous to use for a simple search). While when you think of tasks it might be simpler to capture a task on a paper and pen as it is easy to open up and write.

One of the things that come into my mind with applications is that, in the recent years with all the venture capital funding most of them are created to grab your attention. There are numerous attention grabbing techniques the application focusses on that it doesn't do the main job well. It is all about the notifications or integration of another app. Or there is the topic of payment. There are some applications that don't provide any hosting service, purely relying on a popular cloud platform like iCloud, but still charging a recurring fee to use the application. The incentives of these application is my attention, constant or periodical. 

It will be a tradeoff at the end of the day. You might have to carry yet another item in your pocket along with your phone, to some a smart watch. You may not have the luxury of having the item at hand when you want it. But the beauty of this is that you are left with your own content, without anyone snooping it and selling the data to shady buyers in the wild web.
