I vaguely remember reading this when I was a child. There are too many references to it that my understanding of the story was warped. The 2010 movie made it worse. So when I started reading it I was in for quite a surprise. It tickled the inner child in me and left me pondering about all the bizarre imaginations I had as a child. I would lie if I said the book made sense. It was full of nonsense, yet I could correlate it with certain days in the past. I had fun reading it and so might you.
