I have been reading [[Leadership in Turbulent Times]]. It is the turbulent times that great leaders are formed. Theodore Roosevelt said it well

> If there is not the war, you don't get the great general; if there is not a great occasion, you don't get the great statesman; if Lincoln had lived in times of peace, no one would have known his name now. 

If you don't have an opportunity, would you be able to show your greatness? I don't believe that we should create chaos to show our greatness, but we should definitely make things happen for us instead of waiting for them to happen.
