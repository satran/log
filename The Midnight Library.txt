# The Midnight Library

Overall the book was a decent read. The narrative was alright. The general premise of the book was to be able to live the lives you could have lived if you could do or not do something that you regretted in the current life. There were some deep thoughts the author brought. These made up for the more monotonous different lives the protagonist lived. Towards the end of the book it became a bit too much for me, the lives.
