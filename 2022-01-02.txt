# Day 2

It's so easy to get started with something, but very difficult to continually do it. The trick is to make it a habit. And the easiest way to do that is to do the minimum effort work. For example if you want to read everyday, read every night before you sleep. It could be one paragraph or even one line. That's the minimum effort work. The trick is to tell your brain that it needs to put in this ever so small effort. It doesn't prevent you to stop at that one paragraph, you can continue reading the entire chapter. There will be days when that is possible. And there will be days when only a single sentence will be possible. But since you want to build the habit of reading you are not guilty of doing the minimum effort work. 

I've continuously read for the past few months by just doing this. And this now has become a habit. I read before I sleep, even if that's just one page, even when I sleep at 1 am. 

This is not my idea, rather something I learnt from [[Atomic Habits]] book.
