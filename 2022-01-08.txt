# Day 8

It is easy to get carried off. See I got a bit conceited, thinking I had made it a habit to write and I forgot to write yesterday. This is where I think something like a daily checklist would work. I have heard about the [[Checklist Manifesto]], and it could be time to bring it into my daily routine. It could be all the things that you wish to do that particular day. The recurring things could go in as a template and the tasks that bring you closer to your goals be added the day before.
