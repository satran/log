I like what Bruce Lee said, or at least the internet thinks he said it:

> Instead of buying your children all the things you never had, you should teach them all the things you were never taught. Material wears out but knowledge stays.

What would be the things I would like to teach my daughter? One thing comes up immediately, and that would be how to handle money and how to invest. My dad has been a great source of knowledge and wisdom, but this is one thing that he didn't teach us well. I wish he had instilled this in our early lives. 

Another thing would be how to learn. I don't think this is taught well or rather taught at all. We are expected to learn but hardly anyone teaches you how to learn. The same goes for reading books. You are often required to read books but few are taught how to read them.
