# Day 19

Covid-19 has been quite bad. I'm exhausted most of the day. I haven't been able to focus or put my thoughts to one thing well. Most of the day I'm trying to get some rest. But having a four year old in the house locked up is not easy when you've got Covid-19 along with your wife. This has been quite a stressful few days. I'm hoping it gets over and I can get back to a normal life. At least today I have some energy to write.
