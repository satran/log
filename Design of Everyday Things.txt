> "I shouldn't have to keep a laboratory notebook and do controlled experiments just to set the temperature of my refrigerator".

I had heard a lot of this book before reading it. But every review falls short of its brilliance. From humorous examples of not being able to drain a sink to fatal accidents caused by design flaws Norman keeps you engrossed in the book. He shifts the blame from the user to the design of the product. I could count the times I have blamed the user for my poorly designed applications even feeling frustrated at why they don't get it. 

I would recommend this book to every engineer so that we understand good design principles before building things for humans to use.
